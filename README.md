# A-recommendation-system-for-hotels-and-boarding-houses-in-Can-Tho
Recommender systems can offer relevant information items to users by using data about their past behavior to predict items that users might like. Two successful approaches in the recommender system are collaborative filtering and k-nearest neighbor. In this thesis, another approach is introduced, which is a content-based recommendation system. This research is carried out to collect data on hotels and boarding houses in Cantho city, and to build a web-based recommender system for hotels and boarding houses in Cantho.
